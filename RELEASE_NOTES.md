# Changelog on publishing websites and Discord will be parsed between version header ([x.x.x] - yyyy-mm-dd) and (For Devs) section

## [20.13.5] - 2025-11-11

### Fixed

- Fixed a regression where the Phantom Ascent skill was triggered when
  pressing the jump key while any screen was open (e.g., inventory, chat).
  [#2170](https://github.com/Epic-Fight/epicfight/issues/2170)
- Fixed a crash when right click some blocks from Supplementaries
  [#2187](https://github.com/Epic-Fight/epicfight/issues/2187)
- Fixed patron capes always being default
- Fixed an unintended mechanism where you weren't able to attack in Epic Fight
  mode while Preference Work is set to Switch Mode, so it works in the same way
  as Item Auto Switching option, an old config where automatically sets player
  mode depending on the item that player holds

### Changed

- Refactored the code to eliminate unnecessary native GLFW calls,
  optimizing whether key down checks are performed per tick, by adapting
  Minecraft vanilla `KeyMapping`, which may also potentially fix other compatibility issues with other mods.

### Added

- Built-in Controlify integration for controller support.
  No need to install
  [Epic Fight: Controlify](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/epic-fight-controlify) anymore.
  Install only
  [Controlify: Forgified](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/controlify-forgified-unofficial) on 1.20.1

## [20.13.4] - 2025-11-04

### Changed
- Updated the default config to disable the mine block highlight guide.

### Fixed
- Fixed a crash when joining a world with BadOptimizations installed. [BadOptimizations#108](https://github.com/imthosea/BadOptimizations/issues/108), [#2160](https://github.com/Epic-Fight/epicfight/issues/2160).
- Fixed a crash when joining a world with [Ecliptic Seasons](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ecliptic-seasons) installed.

## [20.13.3] - 2025-11-01

### Bugfix
- Fixed Dedicated Server Crash
- Fixed Epic Fight potentially breaking other controller mods
- Fixed the player can't take blocking when holding weapons from Simplyswords
- Fixed the player's blocking and digging animations not removing under certain conditions (usually when it's combined with dodge skills)
- Blocked the player editing signs when 'resolve_key_conflicts' is set to 'interaction'
- Optimized texture files so that save 23% of size from the original

### For Devs
- Refactored the input system to be less dependent on vanilla Minecraft, allowing other controller mods to provide Epic Fight integration.

## [20.13.2] - 2025-10-24

### Bugfix
- Fixed the 'resolve_key_conflicts' option not to be applied when the player is vanilla mode
- Fixed the 'resolve_key_conflicts' messing up the door state
- Fixed the Ender dragon can't hurt the player

### Configuration
- Added a new config option that you can disable Minecraft model while in vanilla mode (Same as old 'filter animation' option)
- Added a new config option that determines how 'item_preference' works
> - Adaptive: same as current work
> - Switch mode: like the old Epic Fight's 'auto_switching' items, it switches the player mode when the player changes a main hand item, forcing the next behavior depending on the player mode

### Changes
- Made the stun shield persistent

## [20.13.1] - 2025-10-20

### Bugfix
- Fixed the players unable to turn camera in first-person on ladders when y rotation is 180 (or -180)
- Fixed the Technician not rewarding stamina

### Configuration
- Expanded the mining block guide option to configure both crosshair and block highlight overlay
- The config option 'resolve_key_conflicts' has been changed to `key_conflict_resolve_scope` which can cancel the vanilla actions when guard key conflicts with item use key

### Skill and Skill UI
- Added a replace cooldown for each skill slot (#2021)
- Added scrolling to the skill editor and slot selector to further enhance addon extensibility

### Shoulder surfing compatibility
- Players now follow camera when they're taking specific Epic Fight actions (attacks, blocking)

### Etc
- Now players can suppress movements of combo attacks by pressing the sneak key
- Enhanced the block highlight so that it only stains an opaque part
