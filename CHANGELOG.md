    - The feautre is still WIP, supporting only events for EpicFightCameraAPI
    - We will eventually replace all Forge/Neoforge events owned by Epic Fight into Events

  conventions. [#2194](https://github.com/Epic-Fight/epicfight/issues/2194)

  `EpicFightInputAction`.
  [#2194](https://github.com/Epic-Fight/epicfight/issues/2194)

  from MC 1.20.1 to 1.21.1
- Added API JAR file, which includes classes under `yesman/epicfight/api/**` only, to allow consumers to compile against
  Epic Fight public API only.

## [20.13.6] - 2025-11-12

- Fixed patron capes always being default

  mode while Preference Work is set to Switch Mode, so it works in the same way
  as Item Auto Switching option, an old config where automatically sets player
  mode depending on the item that player holds

### Changed

- Refactored the code to eliminate unnecessary native GLFW calls,
  optimizing whether key down checks are performed per tick, by adapting
  Minecraft vanilla `KeyMapping`, which may also potentially fix other compatibility issues with other mods.

  No need to install
  [Epic Fight: Controlify](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/epic-fight-controlify) anymore.

### Shoulder surfing compatibility
- Players now follow camera when they're taking specific Epic Fight actions (attacks, blocking)
